# Cube | CryptoCurrency Simulation Program <img height="35" width="35" src="https://simpleicons.org/icons/elixir.svg" /> 
Ever wanted to know what it feels like to trade with bitcoins? üßê

This simulator gives the user a general overview of what it is like to trade cryptocurrency üí° 



# Controls

- /view: Shows the current amount of money the user has.
- /exit: Exits the current function the user is in, and returns the user to the home page.

## Mine Function 

- "l": Allows you to attempt the hash problem.
- /exit: Exits the current function the user is in, and returns the user to the home page.

## Transaction Function 
- /check_transactions: Allows the user to collect their cube (block) when they have at least 15 transactions under their name.
- /exit: Exits the current functon the user is in, and returns them to the home page.

## Base functions 
- /mine: Initializes the mining feature allowing the user to mine their cube (block).
- /bucks: Initializes the bucks function allowing the user to make quick money by typing "a". 
- /transactions: Allows the user to make a transaction with simulated users.

# Miscellaneous 

This is a simulated program and does not reflect completely the blockchain industry. This program just gives the basics. 

Transactions must be over $5 if the user is going to give money to another user. 

In order for the user to solve the computational problem for the block and win prize money, they must not only solve the problem itself, but they must also have 
their current blockchain validated. If they mess their blockchain up, they have options to either restart, or continute to validate their blockchain.

There is a 1 in 2 chance that a simulated user can send a real-time user money as well, simulating a real-world trading enviornment. 

Proof Of Work is set to 3 zeros. 

When running the block function, every 2 hours the value of money increases allowing the user to gain more money than just the base $5 per "a".

yes or no questions must be answered in all lowercase to avoid bugs.
